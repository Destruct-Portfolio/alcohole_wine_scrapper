    "description": "Founded by sixth-generation Texan, Tito Beveridge, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is known for its high-quality product, charitable contributions, and goal to make people happy while making the world a better place. From the start, Tito got a kick out of infusing vodka for friends and quickly became known as “the vodka guy.” With a dream to do what he loved, and a dog by his side, he pursued a career in the spirits industry, risking it all until he sold his first case. \n\nOver twenty-five years later, Tito’s Handmade Vodka has stayed true to its roots and is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. Our gluten-free, low-calorie* vodka is American-made, unflavored, and distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch, a martini at cocktail hour, or a simple Tito’s and soda with friends – just add Tito’s and enjoy! Distilled and bottled on the same land in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free. Available in Liter, 1.75L, 750mL, 375mL, 200mL, and 50mL sizes. \n\n*(Average Analysis per 1.5oz Tito’s Handmade Vodka: 98 calories, Carbohydrates 0 grams, Protein 0 grams, Fat 0 grams)",

    "description": "Over 150 years ago, Frederick Miller crossed the Atlantic with brewers yeast in his pocket, determined to brew a quality beer that everyone could enjoy. In 1975, Miller Lite established the light beer category and introduced the perfect balance of lightness and flavor nationally. It’s a real Pilsner, brewed to have more color and taste with only 96 calories per 12oz. Since day one, our mission has been to deliver uncompromising quality through a great-tasting American-style Lager. Miller Lite has a golden color and deep flavor, yet is delicately balanced to be light on calories. Our unique process is more time consuming, but has earned us more gold medals for taste than any other light beer. Miller Lite is brewed for more taste with only 96 calories and 3.2g of carbs. In the summer, enjoy Miller Lite on a hot day, at a music festival or during holidays like the 4th of July, Memorial Day, Labor Day or Father&#39;s Day.  It&#39;s also the perfect beer to accompany sporting events such as Football, Basketball, Baseball and NASCAR. Tailgating or hosting a BBQ with friends? Make sure to have Miller Lite on hand. Don&#39;t forget to bring the original light beer to your favorite holiday party (and maybe one of our Ugly Holiday Sweaters) to enjoy with friends.",
